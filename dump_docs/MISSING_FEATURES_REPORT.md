## 🚫 Cancelled Features (Out of Scope for MVP)

### PR10: Polish & Creator UX

#### PR10.1: Undo/Redo System 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Structure exists but not functional~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Current workflow is sufficient for target use cases.
- **Note**: Basic undo/redo structure exists in `timelineState.ts` but will remain unused.

#### PR10.2: Autosave Functionality 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Not implemented~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Users can manually save exports.
- **Note**: Considered unnecessary complexity for the target use case.

#### PR10.3: Text Overlay Tools 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Not implemented~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Focus is on trimming and basic editing.
- **Note**: Transcription feature exists for generating subtitle files, but no video overlay rendering.

#### PR10.4: Transition Effects 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Not implemented~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Current seamless playback is sufficient.
- **Note**: Video player has seamless playback between clips, but no transition effects.

#### PR10.5: Settings Panel Enhancement 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Only API key management exists~~ **DECISION: Keeping current implementation**
- **Current**: `src/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` handles OpenAI API keys only

- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Transcription exports subtitle files (SRT/VTT) which can be used by other video players.
- **Note**: Transcription creates subtitle files (SRT, VTT, TXT, JSON) but no video overlay rendering is planned.

#### PR11.5: Transcription Integration ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Status**: Basic integration exists
- **Missing**:
  - Transcript → Text Overlay workflow

## ⚠️ Partially Missing Features

### Export Enhancements (PR9 Extended)

#### Export Presets 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Not implemented~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Out of scope for MVP. Current export at source quality is sufficient.
- **Note**: Export presets (YouTube, TikTok, etc.) are not planned.

#### Export Quality/Resolution Options 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Placeholder only~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Current**: ExportPanel shows placeholder for Quality/Format/Codec (will remain)
- **Decision**: Export at source quality. Quality/resolution options are not planned.
- **Note**: Users can use external tools if re-encoding is needed.

#### Export Progress Tracking ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Status**: Basic progress exists (isExporting boolean)
- **Missing**:
  - Actual progress percentage for long exports
  - Progress bar with percentage
  - ETA calculation
  - Cancel export functionality
- **Note**: Basic progress indicator is sufficient for MVP. Enhanced tracking is low priority.

#### Export Plan Builder 🚫 CANCELLED
- **Status**: ~~Not implemented~~ **DECISION: Not implementing**
- **Reason**: Current export implementation is sufficient. Export plan builder is not needed.
- **Note**: Multi-clip export works without a separate plan builder component.
